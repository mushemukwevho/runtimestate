I have created this module to monitor state,errors and performance of class methods and functions.
It can monitor methods at runtime. 

The report is optionally dumped into a json file, data.json

You can expose the report as an endpoint in your API. You will be able to analyse the integrity of your methods.

It will monitor fuctions and methods: 
their names, 
their descriptions, 
time it took for the last execution, 
average time of all combined execution, 
frequency of execution(How many times it has run), 
success rate, 
success ratio(percentage),
error generated by last execution, if any,
list of common errors being generated by the fuction and their frequency,
last date and time it was executed

Setup:
 Download or clone the script into your directory

 add... 
 
 from runtimestate import*
